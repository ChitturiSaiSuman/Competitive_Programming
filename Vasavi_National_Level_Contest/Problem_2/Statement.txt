The Faulty Calculator
Find the Result after performing Arithmetic Operations on Numbers.
Tony Stark is organising a Competition, where the winners will be given a free trip to Venice. Scott had never been to Venice, so he thinks this is the best opportunity. The Competetion is all about finding the result when an Arithmetic operation is performed on two numbers. Stark added it is not gonna be very simple. He orders Jarvis to display a Standard Calculator.<p>Pointing to it, he said "Jarvis will be swapping any two numeric keys of the calculator. After **T** such operations, the Calculator's screen will be turned off. Then I am gonna type two Integers **A** and **B**, along with a Mathematical Operator **'.'**. First participant to report the result of **A . B** is the winner."<p>
